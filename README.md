# IMPLEMENTING-DIFFERENT-CPU-SCHEDULING-ALGORITHMS-IN-PARALLEL-PROGRAMMING-STRUCTURE
Task scheduling in parallel processing is a technique in which processes are assigned 
to different processors. Task scheduling in parallel processing uses different types of 
algorithms and techniques which are used to reduce the number of delayed jobs. 
Nowadays there is a different kind of scheduling algorithms and techniques used to 
reduce the execution time of tasks scheduling of jobs in parallel is becoming the 
subject of much research. The problem of job scheduling is to determine how resources 
should be shared in order to maximize the systemâ€™s utility. This problem has been 
extensively studied for well over a decade. In this paper, we will first discuss the 
execution time of scheduling algorithm (LJF, SJF, PRIORITY SCHEDULING) in 
series and parallel, we discuss how deployed scheduling policies can be improved to 
meet existing requirements, specific research challenges and future scope.
